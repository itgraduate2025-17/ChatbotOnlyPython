# Chatbot_UsingOnlyPython
# 

This is a simple rule-based chatbot project built using Python and Gradio.

## What it does
The chatbot responds to basic user messages like hello, how are you, and bye.  
If the input does not match these predefined messages, the chatbot replies that it does not understand.  
It uses a simple web interface for interacting with the user.

## How it is built
- Python: Handles the logic of matching user messages with responses  
- Gradio: Creates an easy-to-use interface for input and output  
- If-elif-else conditions: Used to decide which response to give

## Usage
1. Run the `chatbot.py` file in Google Colab or your local environment  
2. Enter messages in the textbox  
3. The chatbot will respond in the output textbox
